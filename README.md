----

A less opinionated document aggregator and publisher. Easier to use and to adapt than Antora, Hugo, JBake and the likes.

----

## Usage

```help
$ monako -h
Usage of monako:
  -config string
        Configuration file (default "config.monako.yaml")
  -hugo-config string
        Configuration file for hugo (default "config.hugo.toml")

A Docker image is available from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/snipem/monako).

## Design Goals

* Make it simple and stupid
* Git clone existing repositories
  * Don't attempt to change their structure
  * Transform all documents below a specific structure
* Use Antora like configuration file for main structure
* Support Mermaid

## Features

* Multi repository document fetching
* Bundled dependencies (minus Asciidoctor)

## Development

Init with `make init`

## TODOs

* Fail on wrong `docdir` ("TODO")
* Make white list configurable
* The python sharing of python does not support added pathes to the base url. In order to run the path has to be shortened
* Move TOC fix to [monako-book](https://github.com/snipem/monako-book)
* Reduce uncritical warnings by Asciidoctor

## Improvements

* Support edit this page links with links to origin repository. Book theme provides a [similar feature](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book/search?q=BookRepo&unscoped_q=BookRepo).
* Add ability to use diffrent base pathes in local sharing and deployment
